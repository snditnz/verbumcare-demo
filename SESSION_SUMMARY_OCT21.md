- Role-based access: nurse, care_manager, doctor, care_worker, therapist, dietitian
- Session persistence with AsyncStorage
- 24-hour session timeout
- Auto-login check on app launch

### 2. Dashboard/Home Screen ✅

- ✅ Same typography (TYPOGRAPHY from theme)
- ✅ Language toggle in headers
- ✅ Responsive grid layouts
- ✅ Empty states with helpful guidance
- ✅ Loading states for async operations

## 📋 Next Steps (To Do)

### Immediate - Before Testing
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
cd ipad-app
npm install @react-native-community/slider

# 2. Rebuild app
npx expo run:ios
# Or for physical iPad:
npx expo run:ios --device
```

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Login with demo/demo
- [ ] Verify dashboard loads
- [ ] Check statistics are correct
- [ ] Navigate to Patient List
- [ ] Select patient → Patient Info
- [ ] Go to Care Plan Hub
- [ ] Verify "Quick Progress" and "Monitoring" buttons work (not "Coming Soon")
- [ ] Test empty states when no care plan data
- [ ] Test logout
- [ ] Test session persistence (close app, reopen)

### Database Setup (Currently Empty)
The database has 5 patients but 0 care plans. To see full functionality:
- [ ] Create care plans for demo patients
- [ ] Add care plan items with problems/goals
- [ ] Set some items to high priority
- [ ] Set some goals to low progress (<30%)
- [ ] Set some monitoring dates in the past (overdue)

**Quick seed script**: `npm run seed` (if backend has seed script)

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Authentication Flow
```
App Launch
  ↓
AuthStore.checkAuth()
  ↓
[AsyncStorage check]
  ↓
Session valid? → Dashboard
Session invalid? → Login
  ↓
Login success → Save to AsyncStorage → Dashboard
```

### Dashboard Data Flow
```
DashboardScreen
  ↓
useCarePlanStore (carePlans Map)
  ↓
Calculate Alerts:
  - Filter high priority items
  - Find goals with <30% progress
  - Check overdue monitoring dates
  ↓
Display in grid with statistics
```

### Navigation Pattern
```
Login (if not auth)
  ↓
Dashboard (always after login)
  ├─→ PatientList (All Patients button)
  │    └─→ PatientInfo (select patient)
  └─→ PatientInfo (tap patient card)
       ├─→ Vitals/ADL/Pain/etc
       └─→ CarePlanHub
            ├─→ QuickProgressUpdate
            └─→ MonitoringForm
```

- Care plan history/versions
- Export to PDF
- Backend API integration for monitoring

## 💡 Key Decisions Made

### 1. Dashboard First (Not Patient List)
**Decision**: After login, users see Dashboard (facility overview)
**Rationale**: Staff need to see alerts and facility status before diving into individual patients

### 2. Demo Authentication (Not Real)
**Decision**: Hardcoded demo users in authStore
**Rationale**: No backend auth system yet, need to demo the flow

### 3. Empty States Everywhere
**Decision**: Show helpful empty states when data is missing
**Rationale**: User was confused why monitoring showed "Coming Soon" - need clear guidance

### 4. Session Persistence
**Decision**: 24-hour session timeout, stored in AsyncStorage
**Rationale**: Balance between convenience and security for demo

### 5. Match Existing Aesthetic
**Decision**: Card-based design matching PatientInfo screen
**Rationale**: User specifically requested "same look and feel as existing screens"

## 🐛 Issues Discovered & Resolved

### Issue 1: Monitoring Screens Show "Coming Soon"
**Problem**: User reported monitoring features don't work
**Root Cause**: App not rebuilt after Oct 20 commit adding screens
**Solution**: Created REBUILD_REQUIRED.md with rebuild instructions
**Status**: Documented, user needs to rebuild

### Issue 2: No Home Screen
**Problem**: App went straight to patient list, no overview
**Solution**: Built comprehensive Dashboard with facility stats
**Status**: ✅ Complete

### Issue 3: No Authentication
**Problem**: No login, anyone can access
**Solution**: Built LoginScreen + authStore with session management
**Status**: ✅ Complete

### Issue 4: Translation Not Working
**Problem**: getTranslatedText function doesn't work
**Decision**: Deprioritized per user ("more for me than app")
**Status**: ⏸️ On hold

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Ask Questions First**: User's needs weren't fully clear, questions helped clarify

2. **Empty States Matter**: Half the user confusion came from unclear empty states

3. **Rebuild Documentation**: Developer forgot to rebuild after new features - documentation helps

4. **Consistent Design**: Matching existing aesthetic built trust and reduced friction

5. **Progressive Disclosure**: Dashboard → Patient is better flow than Patient → Everything

6. **Context Preservation**: CURRENT_WORK.md proved invaluable for tracking across sessions
